DNS Made Easy API client
=======================

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/test.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/john-k/dnsmadeeasy
)

A Golang client for [DNS Made Easy](https://dnsmadeeasy.com) against their [APIv2 endpoints](https://api-docs.dnsmadeeasy.com/)

# Testing
Create a `.env` file containing the varibles `DME_API_TOKEN` and `DME_API_SECRET` using credentials from your DNS Made Easy Sandbox account, then run `go test -v`

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the load on the DNS Made Easy sandbox environment, it may take an inordinate amount of time to finish creating the two domains that are created during testing.
> 
> If either of the `TestSandboxIntegration/Cleanup_test_domains` calls fail, it will be necessary to manually delete those domains.
